# tg-adapter
Adapter library for porting pytorch code to tinygrad

## Installation
Since there is no pypi package, it must (for now) be installed by running:
`pip install -U git+https://github.com/softcookiepp/tg-adapter.git`

## Testing
Tests are still being migrated from tiny-hf, they cannot be run yet
